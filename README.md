## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### My Thoughts

This Challenge was a lot of fun. The design looks simple and I got to use lots of flexbox. It really boosted my confidence on using it. This was also my first time using mobile first workflow. In this challenge, I used position property. So yeah it was nice.

### Continued development

Get more Experience on Making Responsive Layouts, Mobile First Workflow and probably spent less time on getting widths correct kekw.
